Jennifer Pearson is a social worker at Cook Children's Medical Center, where she works with parents as a non-medical support within the Palliative Care team. Her areas of expertise include helping parents navigate confusing healthcare systems in regards to complex chronic illness and end-of-life concerns. Her research interests include social determinants of health and the impact of family presence on medical outcomes for children admitted to the hospital. She is currently an under-utilized member of the team and is always looking for an outlet for her passion.

Outside of work, Jennifer loves to sew. While her primary love is of quilting, she also loves to sew bags, totes, and anything other than clothing. Jennifer also loves to spend time with her husband, [Chance](https://www.chancetarver.com/), and adventure together.
